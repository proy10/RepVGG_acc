# plan
(Disgard)Design a basic lenet first. Then consider method in "Energy-Efficient Convolution Architecture Based on Rescheduled Dataflow".
Implement a block of RepVGG. The implement of convolution layer can refer to "VWA: HARDWARE EFFICIENT VECTORWISE ACCELERATOR FOR CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK".
conv: tree adder; fix point multiplier;

# design
(Disgard)tb: lenet + src_rom
(Disgard)what does iterator do?
